# Elegant-Bookstore
In this directory, the functionalities of Elegant are demonstrated by a series of demos based on an MVC architecture, E-commerce, Bookstore web application that inspired all the use cases in our (web developers/users) stories. It also contains the most thorough documentation you'll ever need to start a project immediately and top-level UML design of Elegant.

# Elegant
This directory is the heart of this mvc project, Elegant is an Object Relational Mapper framework. The goal of  Elegant is to produce a framework enabling PHP developers to interact with the relational database MySQL through object-oriented PHP instead of having to write out and execute MySQL queries (with its own custom database query builder and handler) producing cleaner, and more readable code. The framework allows the developer to connect to a database through a configuration file. After that, the developer is expected to create a class based on a table in the database which inherits from our Model class. Our Model class will then provide the functionality necessary to interface with that database table.
